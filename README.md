# Welcome to Soda

The Soda Game Engine is an open-source cross-platform game engine built around the [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org) programming language.

Soda is intended to be _easy_ and _fun_, just like MiniScript itself.

### Status

Soda is at the very earliest stage of development right now: defining requirements, and allocating development resources.

### Design Objectives

* easy to install: ideally, a single prebuilt binary on most systems
* easy to use: just `soda myGame.ms` to run
* good performance: hardware acceleration, even on Raspberry Pi
* supported platforms: at least Windows, Mac, Linux (PC), and Raspberry Pi
* support for both text-based console games, and graphical games
* support for keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input
* support for audio in WAV or OGG format, with control over volume, pan, and speed
* shared APIs with [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro) wherever possible

### Underlying Technologies

We are probably going to build Soda on top of SDL, the same framework used in many commercial games.

### How to Help

We need developers!  We also need designers, potential users, and even people who just want to offer words of encouragement.  Contact me (Joe Strout) through any of the community links on the [MiniScript web site](https://miniscript.org), and let's see what we can do together!
